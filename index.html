          <img src="img\me-2019_small.jpg" alt="Serhii's Photo" />
          <p>I love all things about computers and tech since I was a child. When I was 10 years old, my family could not afford to buy me a PC. So, I carved it from a paper. It was the start of a big passion. My very first PC I assembled from parts that I bought separately. Also, I remember how I set up my first Internet connection using a landline phone. That sound of Dial-Up was amazing. I wanted to go to university to get a Computer Science degree. But at the last moment, I gave up on my dream and followed the suggestion of my parents. Then was a master's degree in accounting and a successful career in business and marketing. </p>
          <p>In 2014, I lost a lot in a war in the East of Ukraine. I lost my home, lost my business,  lost my roots. But old passion helped me in difficult times. And I started to learn all that I could find about web development. There were numerous online courses and books about HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I went through. Codecademy, Udemy, Udacity, TeamTreeHouse - you name it! I even found a freelance job for 8 months on Upwork. So, when I entered a Frontend Development Bootcamp in 2016 at a well-known in Ukraine Computer Academy "STEP" I was a skilled student. Mostly I helped other students and was a voluntary teacher assistant during the course. I had several job offers for the position of Junior Frontend Developer right after graduation, but I must support my family, and I left this as a hobby.</p>
        <p>But I knew that big changes in our lives were coming and my hobby can transform into something else. So, here I am in Canada and ready to make my dream happen!</p>
